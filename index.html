            My favourite hobby is riding bicycle. Cycling is an eco-friendly means of transportation hence does not contribute to pollution. It also helps one stay healthy by providing a good deal of excercise.It is also a cheapest and a dependable means of transportation.</p>
        <p>
            German inventor Karl Von Drais is credited with developing the first bicycle.
        </p>
        <p> I started riding tricycle when I was three years old. It was red in colour. I used to ride tricycle inside the house. When I was four years old my father bought new bicycle with side support wheels. I learnt to ride bicycle on my own by removing the side support wheels. </p>
        <p> At the age of six years my father again bought me a new bicycle. It was of my favourite colour red. My friends also learnt cycling on my bicycle. Now my friends also have a bicycle. I ride bicycle in the evening with my friends. Sometimes we have cycle race for fun. Now I have my fourth bicycle with 18 gears, as the chain of my third cycle broke. My new geared bicycle is black in colour and I use it with care now. </p>
        <p> There are many health bebefits of regular cycling, like improved joint mobility, decreased stress levels, strengthened bones, decreased body fat kevels, etc. Disadvantages of cycling is limited traved distance, poor lights etc. </p>
        <p> Cycling will be my favourite hobby forever.</p>
