    <h2>MY FAVOURITE HOBBY</h2>
    <p> I started riding tricycle when I was three years old. It was red in colour. I used to ride tricycle inside the house. When I was four years old my father bought new bicycle with side support wheels. I learnt to ride bicycle on my own by removing the side support wheels. </p>
        <p> At the age of six years my father again bought me a new bicycle. It was of my favourite colour red. My friends also learnt cycling on my bicycle. Now my friends also have a bicycle. I ride bicycle in the evening with my friends. Sometimes we have cycle race for fun. Now I have my fourth bicycle with 18 gears, as the chain of my third cycle broke. My new geared bicycle is black in colour and I use it with care now. </p>
